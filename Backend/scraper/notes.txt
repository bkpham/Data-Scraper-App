Progress
-starting the scraper activates main, which will begin the data scrapper
-right now the database object in app.py is diff than result object sent from main.py, which is causing it to fail to save to database

General Idea
-right now just worrying about ammo
-Upon loading page, should pull all data from the database to populate front page
-If user clicks on a specific ammo type, it should update OR have an update button next to the ammo


start_scraper uses init and is the update function
add_scraper uses add.py and is the add specific url function
start_scraper_all uses scrape_all.py and is the scrape function

3/7/2024 TODO
-modify datascraper to not include $ for price, and not include + for quantity 99+

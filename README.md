# Project Information

This project provides a user interface to interact with an automated price tracking web scraper.

## Libraries/Frameworks/Modules

This project uses:

- React
- Flask
- Playwright

### Python Flask Backend

- `cd backend`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `playwright install`
- `python app.py` or `python3 app.py`

### Running the React Frontend

- `cd frontend`
- `npm i`
- `npm run start`

## Setting Up Automation

To automate the collection of prices from this software simply run the `scheduler/main.py` file at your desired increment while the python flask backend is running.

### Windows

I have created a simple `.bat` script called `run.bat` that you can schedule to execute using the Windows Task Scheduler that will automatically run the backend api and send the appropriate request to it.
